# Configuration file

`Spotifyd` is able to load configuration values from a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/v0.5.0) file too. The file has to be named `spotifyd.conf` and reside in the user's configuration directory (`~/.config/spotifyd`) or the system configuration directory (`/etc` or `/etc/xdg/spotifyd`). This also applies to macOS!

The configuration file consists of two sections, `global` and `spotifyd`, whereas `spotifyd` takes priority over `global`.

The configuration file has the following format:

```toml
[global]
# Your Spotify account name.
username = "username"

# Your Spotify account password.
password = "password"

# A command that gets executed and can be used to
# retrieve your password.
# The command should return the password on stdout.
#
# This is an alternative to the `password` field. Both
# can't be used simultaneously.
password_cmd = "command_that_writes_password_to_stdout"

# If set to true, `spotifyd` tries to look up your
# password in the system's password storage.
#
# This is an alternative to the `password` field. Both
# can't be used simultaneously.
use_keyring = true

# If set to true, `spotifyd` tries to bind to the session dbus
# and expose MPRIS controls. When running headless, without a dbus session,
# then set this to false to avoid binding errors
use_mpris = true

# The audio backend used to play music. To get
# a list of possible backends, run `spotifyd --help`.
backend = "alsa" # use portaudio for macOS [homebrew]

# The alsa audio device to stream audio. To get a
# list of valid devices, run `aplay -L`,
device = "alsa_audio_device"  # omit for macOS

# The alsa control device. By default this is the same
# name as the `device` field.
control = "alsa_audio_device"  # omit for macOS

# The alsa mixer used by `spotifyd`.
mixer = "PCM"  # omit for macOS

# The volume controller. Each one behaves different to
# volume increases. For possible values, run
# `spotifyd --help`.
volume_controller = "alsa"  # use softvol for macOS

# A command that gets executed in your shell after each song changes.
on_song_change_hook = "command_to_run_on_playback_events"

# The name that gets displayed under the connect tab on
# official clients. Spaces are not allowed!
device_name = "device_name_in_spotify_connect"

# The audio bitrate. 96, 160 or 320 kbit/s
bitrate = 160

# The directory used to cache audio data. This setting can save
# a lot of bandwidth when activated, as it will avoid re-downloading
# audio files when replaying them.
#
# Note: The file path does not get expanded. Environment variables and
# shell placeholders like $HOME or ~ don't work!
cache_path = "cache_directory"

# The maximal size of the cache directory in bytes
# The example value corresponds to ~ 1GB
max_cache_size = 1000000000

# If set to true, audio data does NOT get cached.
no_audio_cache = true

# Volume on startup between 0 and 100
# NOTE: This variable's type will change in v0.4, to a number (instead of string)
initial_volume = "90"

# If set to true, enables volume normalisation between songs.
volume_normalisation = true

# The normalisation pregain that is applied for each song.
normalisation_pregain = -10

# After the music playback has ended, start playing similar songs based on the previous tracks.
autoplay = true

# The port `spotifyd` uses to announce its service over the network.
zeroconf_port = 1234

# The proxy `spotifyd` will use to connect to spotify.
proxy = "http://proxy.example.org:8080"

# The displayed device type in Spotify clients.
# Can be unknown, computer, tablet, smartphone, speaker, t_v,
# a_v_r (Audio/Video Receiver), s_t_b (Set-Top Box), and audio_dongle.
device_type = "speaker"
```

## Alternatives to storing your password in the config file <!-- omit in toc -->

- **`password_cmd`** config entry

  This feature allows you to provide a command that prints your password to `stdout`, which saves you from having to store your password in the config file directly. To use it, set the `password_cmd` config entry to the command you would like to use and remove the `password` config entry.

  For example (using the password-management utility [pass][pass-homepage]).

  ```toml
  # ~/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf
  password_cmd = "pass spotify"
  ```

- **`use_keyring`** config entry / **`--use-keyring`** CLI flag <!-- omit in toc -->

  This features leverages [Linux's DBus Secret Service API][secret-storage-specification] or native macOS keychain in order to forgo the need to store your password directly in the config file. To use it, compile with the `dbus_keyring` feature and set the `use-keyring` config entry to `true` or pass the `--use-keyring` CLI flag  during start to the daemon. Remove the `password` and/or `password_cmd` config entries.

  Your keyring entry needs to have the following attributes set:

  ```yaml
  application: rust-keyring
  service: spotifyd
  username: <your-spotify-username>
  ```

  To add such an entry into your keyring, you can use `secret-tool`, a CLI used to communicate with agents that support the Secret Service API:

  ```bash
  secret-tool store --label='name you choose' application rust-keyring service spotifyd username <your-username>
  ```

  You can use the keychain GUI on macOS to add an item respectively, or with the built-in `security` tool:

  ```bash
  security add-generic-password -s spotifyd -D rust-keyring -a <your username> -w
  ```

## Shell used to run commands indicated by `password_cmd` or `on_song_changed_hook` <!-- omit in toc -->

If either of these options is given, the shell `spotifyd` will use to run its commands is the shell indicated by the `SHELL` environment variable, if set. If the `SHELL` environment variable is not set, `spotifyd` will use the user's default shell, which, on Linux and BSD, is the shell listed in `/etc/passwd`. On macOS it is the shell listed in the output of `dscl . -read /Users/<username> UserShell`.
