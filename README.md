> An open source Spotify client running as a UNIX daemon.

Spotifyd streams music just like the official client, but is more lightweight and supports more platforms. Spotifyd also supports the Spotify Connect protocol, which makes it show up as a device that can be controlled from the official clients.

> __Note:__ Spotifyd requires a Spotify Premium account.

__To read about how to install and configure Spotifyd, take a look at our [wiki][wiki]!__
